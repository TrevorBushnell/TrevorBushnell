### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of data science and statistics. I use Python, R, and Julia to do my data science and computational mathematics tasks. 

#### New To Me? Start Here:
* [My Honors Thesis - Singable AI Bach:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Singing-AI-Bach) the codebase for my honors thesis, including my final paper, research articles, code that I wrote, and more.
* [Splatoon 3 Battle Data:](https://splatoon3battledata.streamlit.app/) the website where my battle data regarding Splatoon 3 gets displayed.

#### Resources
Check out any of these resources that I have pubicly available:

* [STEM Notes:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/STEM-Notes) Find notes to many math/computer science courses that I have taken in my collegiate career. Written in Jupyter notebooks and LaTeX. 
* [Data Science Resources:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Data-Science-Resources) My notes, cheat sheets, and other resources I have created for learning and mastering data science. Will be continuously updated as I learn more!
* [Numerical Methods in Julia:](https://trevorbushnell.github.io/Numerical-Methods-Julia-VS-MATLAB/) Learn about various different numerical methods that are used in mathematics, and see my impementation of these algorithms in Julia. Also see benchmarks comparing Julia VS MATLAB implementations of the same algorithms (project in progress - check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Numerical-Methods-Julia-VS-MATLAB)).

#### Data Science Projects
My data science capstone project is a [Splatoon 3 Battle Analytics website](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Splatoon3BattleData), which uses GitHub Actions to automatically pull and update my battle statistics for my Splatoon 3 battle game. Additionally, I have other data science projects where I analyze [my own typing data](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/MonkeyType-Data-Project) and predict the results of [League of Legends games](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/League-Game-Prediction-Project).

#### Other Projects
I occasionally develop on projects for the speedrunning community, including simple bingo generators and trackers for speedruns. Additionally, I'm passionate about SSI (self-sovereign identity), a new technology that is allowing us to verify our identities on the internet - a feat that we have yet to accomplish in the digital age.

#### LinkedIn

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-bushnell-737546229/) profile is a work in progress, but feel free to check me out over there.
