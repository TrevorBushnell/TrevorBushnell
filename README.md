### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate with a focus on data science and statistics. While I currently work as a software developer primarily working in Rust and Python, I also dabble in R and Julia for my side data projects.

#### New To Me? Start Here:
* [My Honors Thesis - Singable AI Bach:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Singing-AI-Bach) the codebase for my honors thesis, including my final paper, research articles, code that I wrote, and more.
* [Livesplit Parser:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/livesplit_parser) An open-source Python library for analyzing speedrunning data by passing in a Livesplit timer. Currently under development and pull requests are welcome!
* [STEM Notes:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/STEM-Notes) Find notes to many math/computer science courses that I have taken in my collegiate career. Written in Jupyter notebooks and LaTeX. 

#### Data Science Projects
My data science capstone project is a [Splatoon 3 Battle Analytics website](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Splatoon3BattleData), which uses GitHub Actions to automatically pull and update my battle statistics for my Splatoon 3 battle game. Additionally, I have other data science projects where I analyze [my own typing data](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/MonkeyType-Data-Project) and predict the results of [League of Legends games](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/League-Game-Prediction-Project).

#### Other Projects
I occasionally develop on projects for the speedrunning community, including simple bingo generators and trackers for speedruns. Additionally, I'm super passionate about computational musicology - i.e. how we can use computer programming to analyze many scores to find trends in music in a much faster and efficient manner than through reading scores by hand.

#### LinkedIn
