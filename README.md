### Hi there 👋

I'm a student of data science and statistics. I use Python, R, and Julia to do my data science and computational mathematics tasks. 

#### Resources
Check out any of these resources that I have pubicly available:

* [STEM Notes:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/STEM-Notes) Find notes to many math/computer science courses that I have taken in my collegiate career. Written in Jupyter notebooks and LaTeX. 
* [Data Science Resources:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Data-Science-Resources) My notes, cheat sheets, and other resources I have created for learning and mastering data science. Will be continuously updated as I learn more!
* [Numerical Methods in Julia:](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/Numerical-Methods-Julia) Learn about various different numerical methods that are used in mathematics, and see my impementation of these algorithms in Julia. Also see benchmarks comparing Julia VS MATLAB implementations of the same algorithms (project in progress).

#### Data Science Projects
I have done very basic projects in my studies where I analyze [my own typing data](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/MonkeyType-Data-Project) and predict the results of [League of Legends games](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/League-Game-Prediction-Project). 

#### Other Projects
I occasionally develop on projects for the speedrunning community, including simple bingo generators and trackers for speedruns.
